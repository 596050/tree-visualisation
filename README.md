# tree-visualisation
A modification of [David Galles' visualisation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/about.html) of [BSTs](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html), [B-Trees](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html) and [Red-Black-Trees](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html).

### Modifications
- Multiple values can be inserted at once (input is split at any non-digit character, causing that...)
- Only numbers can be added
- A number of random values between `0000` and `9999` can be inserted
